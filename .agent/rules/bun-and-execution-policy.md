# Bun Package Management and Execution Policy

## Package Management with Bun

This project uses **Bun** as the package manager and runtime environment. The presence of [bun.lock](mdc:bun.lock) confirms this setup.

### Package Installation Guidelines

- **Always use Bun** for package installation, never npm or yarn
- **Command format**: Use `bun add <package>` for dependencies
- **Dev dependencies**: Use `bun add -d <package>` for development dependencies
- **Global packages**: Use `bun add -g <package>` for global installations
- **Package removal**: Use `bun remove <package>` to uninstall packages

### Package Installation Examples

```bash
# Install runtime dependency
bun add express

# Install development dependency
bun add -d @types/node

# Install multiple packages
bun add lodash axios zod

# Install specific version
bun add express@4.18.0
```

### Project Dependencies

The project dependencies are managed through [package.json](mdc:package.json) and locked in [bun.lock](mdc:bun.lock).

## Execution Policy

### Strict No-Execution Rule

**CRITICAL**: Do not run, execute, build, or test any code unless explicitly requested by the user.

This includes:

- ❌ Do not run `bun run` commands
- ❌ Do not execute `bun start`, `bun dev`, or `bun build`
- ❌ Do not run tests with `bun test`
- ❌ Do not execute any npm scripts defined in package.json
- ❌ Do not run database migrations or seeds
- ❌ Do not start development servers
- ❌ Do not execute any shell commands that run the application

### What You CAN Do

- ✅ Install packages when needed for development
- ✅ Read and analyze code files
- ✅ Make code modifications and improvements
- ✅ Suggest commands for the user to run
- ✅ Create or modify configuration files
- ✅ Generate code and documentation

### When User Requests Execution

Only when the user explicitly asks to run something:

- Propose the command using the terminal tool
- Wait for user approval before execution
- Use appropriate Bun commands (not npm/yarn equivalents)

### Example Appropriate Responses

❌ **Wrong**: "Let me run the tests to check if this works..."
✅ **Correct**: "You can test this by running: `bun test`"

❌ **Wrong**: "I'll start the development server to verify..."
✅ **Correct**: "To start the development server, use: `bun run dev`"

## Installation Priority

When suggesting package installations, prioritize:

1. Official packages over community alternatives
2. TypeScript-compatible packages
3. Well-maintained packages with recent updates
